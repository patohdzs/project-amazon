        "\n",
        "The provided Python code has the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Transition Matrix and Instantaneous Generator:** It first defines a transition probability matrix `P`, and then calculates an instantaneous generator `M` using the logarithm of the matrix `P` divided by a time step `dτ`. It then calculates `m1` and `m2` as the off-diagonal elements of `M`. Finally, it computes a new transition matrix `P` by taking the matrix exponential of `M` multiplied by a time step `dt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Markov Array Generation:** The code generates a `Markov array` that contains all possible sequences of 0s and 1s of length `T_u + 1`. This is done using the `itertools.product` function, which computes the Cartesian product of `[0, 1]` repeated `T_u + 1` times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Price Matrix Initialization and Filling:** It initializes a `price matrix` that has the same number of rows as the Markov array and `T+1` columns. The matrix is filled with zeros initially. The first `T_u + 1` columns of the price matrix are filled with the Markov array. The remaining columns are filled with the last column of the Markov array, utilizing NumPy's broadcasting feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Price Matrix Adjustment:** All zeros in the price matrix are replaced with the value `p1`, and all ones are replaced with `p2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Probability Matrix Initialization and Calculation:** A `probability matrix` is initialized with the same number of rows as the Markov array and one column. For each row of the Markov array, the code computes a probability that corresponds to the sequence of 0s and 1s in that row. This probability is calculated as the product of transition probabilities from the `P` matrix for each pair of adjacent elements in the sequence. The computed probability is stored in the corresponding row of the probability matrix.\n",

        "## 3.1 Introduction of MPC\n",
        "The provided Python script is a representation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization routine, a popular strategy in control theory. MPC utilizes an optimization routine at each time step to determine the optimal control inputs, achieved by minimizing a defined cost or objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "MPC operates on a receding horizon strategy, meaning it uses current state measurements to solve an optimization problem over a finite future time period or horizon. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps\n",
        "1. System Modeling: MPC requires a predictive model of the system. This model describes how the system evolves over time given current state and control inputs. Models can be derived from first principles (physics-based) or identified from experimental data (data-driven models such as machine learning algorithms).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Formulation of the Optimization Problem: The core of MPC is the optimization problem, which is formulated in terms of an objective function to be minimized. This function is often the sum of the deviations of the system output from a desired setpoint (tracking errors) and the control effort (to keep actuation smooth and avoid excessive wear and tear on the system). Constraints are also incorporated, which may represent physical limits of the system (like actuator saturation) or safety requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Solving the Optimization Problem: At each control step, using the current state of the system as initial conditions, MPC solves the optimization problem over a prediction horizon extending into the future. The solution is a sequence of optimal control actions that minimize the cost function over the prediction horizon while satisfying the constraints. (ADD STOCHASTIC HORIZON STUFF)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implementation of Control Action: Only the first control action from the optimal sequence is implemented, and the system moves to the next state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Receding Horizon Strategy: The horizon moves forward in time (hence \"receding horizon\"), and the procedure is repeated at the next time step: the new current state of the system is measured, a new optimization problem is solved over the shifted horizon, the first control action is implemented, and so on. This receding horizon strategy allows MPC to react to new measurements and disturbances, providing feedback control.\n",
